## üöÄ About LexiConvert

LexiConvert is a file conversion application designed for users who prioritize privacy and efficiency. Unlike traditional online conversion tools, LexiConvert leverages the power of your browser to perform all conversion tasks **locally and offline**. Once the application is loaded, you no longer need an internet connection. This means your files never leave your computer, guaranteeing absolute data security and privacy. Whether you need to convert images, documents, audio, or video, LexiConvert provides a seamless, secure, and performant solution.

**Core Features:**
*   **Offline First**: All file conversions happen within your browser's sandbox. After the initial load, no internet connection is needed.
*   **Absolute Privacy**: Your data is never uploaded to any server. It remains 100% private and on your device.
*   **Extensive Format Support**:
    *   **Documents**: Convert DOCX, XLSX, EPUB, and TXT files to PDF. Extract pages from PDFs into images (PNG, JPG, etc.).
    *   **Images**: Convert between common image formats like PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, GIF, and even convert images to PDF, SVG (experimental), or ICO.
    *   **Audio/Video**: Perform basic conversions for audio (MP3, WAV) and video (MP4, GIF, MP3 extraction). *(Note: Relies on mock API calls in this version, designed to be replaced with a real backend service).*
*   **Batch Processing**: Easily upload multiple files and convert them to your desired format in one go.
*   **Persistent History**: Your conversion history is automatically saved locally using IndexedDB, allowing you to re-download past files at any time.
*   **Secure Session Locking**: An optional password feature protects your session and history from unauthorized access.
*   **Modern UI**: A beautiful and responsive interface built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## üîí Security Policy

We treat your data security and privacy as our highest priority. Here are the security measures adopted by LexiConvert:

*   **Client-Side Processing**: This is our core security promise. All file reading, processing, and conversion occur entirely within your browser's sandboxed environment. No file data is ever uploaded to any server.

*   **Local Storage**: Your conversion history, including the file data itself, is securely stored on your local machine using the browser's `IndexedDB` technology. This allows you to retain your work even if you close the browser, while ensuring your data never leaves your device.

*   **Optional Session Password Protection**:
    *   On first use, you can choose to set a password to protect your application.
    *   If a password is set, it must be entered each time you open or refresh the page to access your conversion history.

*   **Progressive Brute-Force Protection**:
    *   To prevent password guessing, we've implemented a progressive lockout mechanism.
    *   10 consecutive incorrect password entries will lock the account for 1 minute.
    *   2 more incorrect entries will result in a 1-hour lockout.
    *   If 2 more entries are incorrect, the tool will be permanently disabled until you choose to manually delete all local data (including the password and history) to reset the application.
